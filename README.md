# Password Generator

A program that takes a first/last name (or two words) to provide a username. Then takes input on desired password length to output username/password combination. 

## Functionality

Username can be adjusted by changing the slices in the username function [:1]. Random and strings are imported to generate random output and reduce lines of code.
